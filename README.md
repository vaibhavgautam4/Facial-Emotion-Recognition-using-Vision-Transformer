# Facial Emotion Recognition using Vision Transformer
 
Spearheaded the creation of a facial emotion detection model using VIT and MobileNet architectures.
we have tried and tested VIT transfer model to learn features and able to recognize them with more accuracy and precision.
A Model that can Understand and Extract Human emotions from a given image efficiently.

- Demonstrated proficiency in computer vision, leading the development of the emotion detection model.

- Looking forward to Translate model capabilities into a practical web application,enabling real-time emotion analysis for users.

- [FER 2013](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) Dataset is used for the training of model.
